## LR Suggestions

I think in terms of the first day lecture, just make the point what is course is about and what is not about. It might help to have a small description of the course with the intended learning outcomes and a short syllabus for each day. In this syllabus you can also include a short description of which topics will be definitely included and which topics are tentative.
